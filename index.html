       <h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
      
     Did you know that the apostrophe S " S' " has the General name to be GENITIVES? 
     I believe you use the apostrophe S to indicate possession or belongingness.
     For instance;

     <br>
      Ada uses the company's laptop. (This use of the genitive indicates possession. The laptop Ada uses belongs to the company.)

    </p>
    </div>
   
      <!-- <content> this contains 1st content?</content> -->
     <div>
       <p>
       Let's have three (3) other ways we can use the genitive apart from using it to indicate possession or belongingness.
     Great!
    </p>
     </div>
    <br>
     <div>
       <p>
        1. The second way to use the genitive is to use it to indicate that something is a part of another.
     For example; The door's handle is new. (This means that the new handle is a part of the door but not to mean the new handle belongs to the door.)
     <br>The car's tyre is flat. (The tyre is a part of the car but does not belong to the car) </br>
     </p>
     </div>
     
    <br>
     <div>
       <p> 
       2. The third way to use the genitive is to use it to indicate that something is made specifically for. For instance;
     This is children's wear. (This is made specifically for the use of children)
     <br>
     It is an adult's service. (The service is specifically for adults)</br>
     </p>
     </div>
     
     <br>
     <div>
       <p>
       3. The fourth way to use genitive is to use it to show that something is associated with another. For instance;
     I visited John's school today. (This does not mean the school belongs to John, if he does not own the school BUT it means John is associated with the school, maybe John schools there or has schooled there.)
     <br> The man's company sacked him. (This means that the man is associated with the company that sacked him.)<br>
     </p>
     </div>


     <div>
       <P>
         <br>SUMMARY</br>

         In summary, the genitive is popularly called the apostrophe s and we have looked at four ways the GENITIVE is used. It is used to indicate the relationship of possession or belongingness, association, to indicate that something is a part of another and also to indicate that something is made specifically for.
